# Newsweek

Another 'The Odin Project' assignment. This project focuses on using a CSS library called Bootstrap to remake the Newsweek home page.


During the course of remaking this site, I ended up using FlexBox a lot and I saw it's power. I learned that Bootstrap's grid
system is built on FlexBox and with it's accompanying CSS attributes I learned that FlexBox is a powerful tool when it comes to
organizing components on a page. 

- justify-content : removes the need to float block level items.
- align-items : also makes vertically aligning components a breeze.
- order : allows me to control the order the components are rendered on the page (game changing).


The original page can be found [here](https://www.newsweek.com/).

And my remake of the page [here](https://aznafro.github.io/newsweek/).
