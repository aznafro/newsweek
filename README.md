# Newsweek

Another 'The Odin Project' assignment. This project focuses on using a CSS library called Bootstrap. Bootstrap has been,
and probably still is, one of the most popular and widely used CSS libraries. Just about all components come out of the box
and with their grid system and responsive media, responsive design becomes a breeze. 

In this project I remake the Newsweek home page.


During the course of remaking this site, I ended up using FlexBox a lot and I saw it's power. I learned that Bootstrap's grid
system is built on FlexBox and with it's accompanying CSS attributes I learned that FlexBox is a powerful tool when it comes to
organizing components on a page. 

- justify-content : removes the need to float block level items.
- align-items : also makes vertically aligning components a breeze.
- order : allows me to control the order the components are rendered on the page (game changing).
