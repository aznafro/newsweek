# Newsweek

Another 'The Odin Project' assignment. This project focuses on using a CSS library called Bootstrap. Bootstrap has been,
and probably still is, one of the most popular and widely used CSS libraries. Just about all components come out of the box
and with their grid system and responsive media, responsive design becomes a breeze. 

In this project I remake the Newsweek home page.


The original page can be found [here](https://www.newsweek.com/).

And my remake of the page [here](https://aznafro.github.io/newsweek/).
